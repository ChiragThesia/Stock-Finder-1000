## Stock Finder 1000
Allows users to pull the top stocks from various stock discord channels. 

## Motivation
I follow many groups to keep up with the current trends and current investments that are hot. its too much to have 10-15 tabs open so I wanted to create a single source where I can perform these tasks. My friend and I build this to do just that.
